        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics. Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save remotely. Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses, allowing for cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security.</p>

        <h2>Function of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/definition/images/cloud-computing-definition5.png" alt="" id="image-left" >
        <ol id="olf">
            <li><b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) </b></li>
                <p>IaaS is a cloud computing infrastructure that provides compute, network, and storage resources over the internet, via a subscription model that can scale. It’s a foundational cloud service that can build or complement platform as a service (PaaS) and SaaS. Many agile and DevOps teams use IaaS to build their platforms. Since it’s offered as a subscription service, it can scale up or down as needed, providing greater flexibility compared to on-premise infrastructures.</p>
            <li><b>Platform as a service (PasS)</b> </li>
                <p>PaaS is a cloud infrastructure layer that provides resources to build user-level tools and applications. Like IaaS, these resources include servers, storage, and networking. PaaS also includes development tools, database management systems, middleware, email or notification systems, and more. </p>  
            <li><b>Containers as a service (CaaS)</b> </li>
                <p>CaaS is essentially automated hosting and deployment of containerized software packages. Without CaaS, software development teams need to deploy, manage, and monitor the underlying infrastructure that containers run on. This infrastructure is a collection of cloud machines and network routing systems that requires dedicated DevOps resources to oversee and manage. </p>
            <li><b>Software as a service (SaaS)</b> </li>
                <p>The SaaS provider is responsible for operating, managing and maintaining the software and the infrastructure on which it runs. The customer simply creates an account, pays a fee and gets to work.</p>
            <li><b>Serverless computing</b> </li>
                <p>Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All that the developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider. The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning the cloud infrastructure that is required to run the code and scaling the infrastructure up and down on demand as needed. The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more.</p>

        <!-- Give 10 benefits and description of Cloud Computnig using the ul list you can search how the element works -->
        <ul> <li><b>Accessibility anywhere, with any device</b></li>
                <p>each branch or office across various states or countries. The improved accessibility doesn’t just impact employees; clients and customers can also log in to an account and access their information as well. This ensures everyone has up-to-date information whether they’re at the office or on the go.</p>
            <li><b>Ability to get rid of most or all hardware and software</b></li>
                <p>With cloud computing, you’re no longer required to have your own server, cables, network switches, backup generators, redundant routers, and so on. Depending on the cloud provider you choose, they can manage all of this for a monthly fee. Reducing expenses is essential in any business model and every cloud-based platform benefits from this factor alone.</p>
            <li><b>Centralized data security</b></li>
                <p>When you use cloud computing, data backups are centralized in the cloud providers' data centers, removing the need for individual users or teams to maintain their own backups onsite or offsite. This lowers the risk of data loss should any one backup fail or be destroyed by a disaster. Cloud providers can restore the data from another copy maintained in their cloud storage, which is continuously updated with every piece of data added.

                    Teams can take advantage of cloud security technologies such as data encryption and two-factor authentication for greater privacy than they'd have when relying on their own equipment or servers at home or in the office. Oracle uses a security-first cloud architecture with automated protection built in.</p>
            <li><b>Higher performance and availability</b></li>
                <p>By using cloud computing resources together simultaneously, you reap greater performance gains than by having your own dedicated server hardware. Cloud computing increases input/output operations per second (IOPS). Oracle cloud delivers as much as 20X the IOPS of Amazon Web Services.</p>
            <li><b>Quick application deployment</b></li>
                <p>Unpredictable business needs often require cloud computing resources on short notice. You can improve your cloud application development by quickly deploying cloud applications because they are readily available without the need to procure additional hardware or wait for IT staff to set up servers.

                    In addition you can choose from a broad range of services that support different types of cloud infrastructure technologies.</p>
            <li><b>Instant business insights</b></li>
                <p>Cloud-based platforms provide a unique opportunity to access data as soon as it’s collected. This facilitates better decision-making as well as insight into what the future may hold for your organization based on predictions from historical data.</p>
            <li><b>Business continuity</b></li>
                <p>In the event of disaster or unforeseen circumstances, do you have an effective backup plan? If not, relying on cloud computing services can benefit your organization. Cloud computing uses infinite data storage space and systems that can be activated remotely if necessary to ensure business continuity.</p>
            <li><b>Price-performance and cost savings</b></li>
                <p>Although an initial financial investment is required to implement a cloud strategy, organizations save substantial amounts in the long run because they don’t have to maintain expensive hardware or local data centers. Also, since there are no upfront costs to use cloud-based systems, businesses can test them out before investing in them at their own pace. Oracle provides price-performance and flexible sizing.</p>
            <li><b>Virtualized computing</b></li>
                <p>Cloud computing is perfect for virtualized computer environments because cloud resources can be allocated instantly to support significant increases in demand so you never experience downtime again. With cloud computing, your business can expand its capabilities almost effortlessly to meet growing demands without increasing staff or capital expenditures.</p>
            <li><b>Cloud computing is greener</b></li>
                <p>Cloud computing is a greener technology than traditional IT solutions. By moving to the cloud, businesses can reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint by up to 90%. Rather than having in-house servers and software, businesses can use cloud-based services to access the same applications and data from any computer or device with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for businesses to purchase and maintain their own IT infrastructure.

                    If you're looking for a greener, more cost-effective way to deliver your IT services, consider moving to the cloud.</p>

        <!-- Give 5 Advantages and Description of Cloud Computing using the ul listing -->
        <li><b>Downtime</b></li>
            <p>Downtime is often cited as one of the biggest cloud computing disadvantages. Since cloud computing systems are internet-based, service outages are always an unfortunate possibility and can occur for any reason.</p>
        <li><b>Security and privacy</b></li>
            <p>Although cloud service providers implement the best security standards and industry certifications, storing data and important files on external service providers always opens up risks. Any discussion involving data must address security and privacy, especially when it comes to managing sensitive data. We must not forget what happened at Code Space and the hacking of their AWS EC2 console, which led to data deletion and the eventual shutdown of the company. Their dependence on remote cloud-based infrastructure meant taking on the risks of outsourcing everything.</p>
        <li><b> Vulnerability to attack</b></li>
            <p>Going on with the drawbacks of cloud computing, another one concerns vulnerability: in cloud computing, every component is online, which exposes potential vulnerabilities. Even the best teams suffer severe attacks and security breaches from time to time. Since cloud computing is built as a public service, it’s easy to run before you learn to walk. After all, no one at a cloud vendor checks your administration skills before granting you an account: all it takes to get started is generally a valid credit card.</p>
        <li><b>Limited control and flexibility</b></li>
            <p>Since the cloud infrastructure is entirely owned, managed, and monitored by the cloud service provider, it transfers minimal control over to the customer.To varying degrees (depending on the particular service), cloud users may find they have less control over the function and execution of services within a cloud-hosted infrastructure. A cloud provider’s end-user license agreement (EULA) and management policies might impose limits on what customers can do with their deployments. Customers retain control of their applications, data, and services, but may not have the same level of control over their backend infrastructure.</p>
         <li><b>Vendor lock-in</b></li>
            <p>Vendor lock-in is another perceived disadvantage of cloud computing. Easy switching between cloud services is a service that hasn’t yet completely evolved, and organizations may find it difficult to migrate their services from one vendor to another. Differences between vendor platforms may create difficulties in migrating from one cloud platform to another, which could equate to additional costs and configuration complexities. Gaps or compromises made during migration could also expose your data to additional security and privacy vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <!-- For you as a student what is the help of Cloud Computing in
        your daily life in schools and personal uses, Will you also recommend 
        using cloud for the others -->
        <p>Yes, Because Cloud Computing help us in every different way in our daily life, we might not see it but cloud computing is everywhere now a days technologies. Cloud Computing help you in your schools or personal use when using your devices, a lot of company  uses cloud computing for exmaple the online shopping, spotify, and even netflix uses the Cloud Computing for their business as service even google drive is a cloud computing because you used it to download or uploads your data/files to save them.</p>
